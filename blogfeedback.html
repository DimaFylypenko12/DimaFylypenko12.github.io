    Welcome Dmytro Fylypenko,

Thank you for submitting your “Who Am I?” form. The feedback given here is for you to use when you start the program, so you don’t have to respond to it just now.

Your motivation is nice but still a bit too general, why are you interested in IT, in programming? What potential do you see in this type of career and why? What makes you interested in this study program in particular? Why did you enjoy it before in your previous experience? I recommend you check what interests you most about this type of career and to search for the true motivation that will keep you going throughout the study program. This will be very helpful in difficult situations or challenges that you may encounter during your education.

    When looking at your goals after completing your studies, it is nice to see you are interested in becoming a software engineer. Besides working on code, what else do you enjoy in being a software engineer? Why does it appeal to you more than being a programmer? Would you enjoy working in a team? I would recommend you try and research more about software engineering but maybe other positions as well just to understand your options, what would you like to do in your day to day? How would you like your role to look like? Look more into the program, what interests you in the courses taught. I also recommend you participate in the ICT conference upcoming year where youll meet companies and can get more information about different professions in the ICT field.

    Looking at your personal analysis, it is clear you are aware and thought about your strengths and weaknesses, this is very good and beneficial to understand yourself and to become a better professional in the future. Considering your weakness, its good you are aware of it, to help you I recommend checking for tools that may help you be more organized and to work in schedule. Also maybe prepare mentally and search for some tools that may help you handling unfamiliar situations and work in groups, as there will be many projects in teams during this program, don’t be worried! There are others that surely feel the same, youre all starting a new path and it is scary but youll meet new friends. Moreover, youll have a personal study career coach (one of the lecturers) that will accompany you, student assistants and study buddies.  I understand that it may be difficult and not always will be smooth or fun working with others in groups, but I can assure you, youll learn a lot from your teammates, it will help you develop and enrich your knowledge and views, so try and come with an open mind to them as much as possible.
